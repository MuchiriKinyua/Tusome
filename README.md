# Project description and background

The learning management system has been integrated with the Kenyan education system in recent years and has since become a norm for any student joining any college in the country. The learning management system is a mobile-based platform that is utilized to orchestrate, implement, and access categorical learning programs. It entails instructors who create and distribute content, monitor and grade students' performance, evaluate and access students' progress, and students get a platform to access their documents, join video conferences, and track their performance while receiving genuine-time feedback from their instructors. The learning management system is important in education because it provides many benefits to school administration, such as continuously monitoring teaching and learning systems and detailed analytics and reports that help track students' academic progress. Management can also keep track of the lessons that the teachers complete without constantly asking for updates. Tusome's Learning Management System provides digital content that reflects the school's efficiency through secure sign-ins so that only school staff can access the information. Teachers can benefit from LMS because it allows them to plan lessons, share notes, and quickly answer questions using the digital content support feature. They can use LMS software to supplement students' learning experiences with a variety of content formats.

# Problem statement
Tusome school is a newly established school that has a gradual increase in student population, which has led to a constraint on the school facilities. Students also coming from different parts of the country have to relocate and find accommodation which can be stressful. The implementation of the learning management system will help the students access learning resources remotely while ensuring the school facilities are equally distributed. The learning management system will also ensure less constraint on the students while providing them with flexibility.
